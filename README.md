### Notes —

1. Due to size limitation of GitHub repositories, this project does not include any assets of the game provided in this
   course.
2. Commit messages are mostly the course lecture titles, except some of them are for important fixes or updating
   this [README.md](./README.md) file.
3. Since the Unreal Engine's version is `5.2.1-26001984`, the version used for Visual Studio 2022 IDE is `17.11.5`. This
   is to avoid compilation issues encountered for later updated versions of its components and tools.
